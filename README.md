# What's Next?

## A movie tracking and recommendation app.

This application will allow a user to *log movies*
that they have already seen and *rate them*. 
They can also get *recommendations* for new movies 
to watch, based on *genres* they prefer and movies 
that they have watched in the past. They will also 
be able to find out which streaming services the 
movie is on, if any.

This app may be of interest to people that can not 
decide what movie to watch next, or previously 
enjoyed a movie and want to watch something similar. 
This project is of interest to me because I have 
spent far too much time deciding what to watch 
instead of actually watching something. I have also 
started watching movies that I had previously seen, 
forgetting my previous viewing. Having a list of 
movies that I have already watched may help with that
problem.
